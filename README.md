# io_scene_mk8muunt

This is a Blender add-on to import and export Mario Kart 8 Course Info BYAML files (those with "muunt" in their name).

It is currently in the alpha stage and supports the following Course BYAML sections:

| Feature                        | Import | Edit   | Export | Status |
| ------------------------------ | :----: | :----: | :----: | ------ |
| Main Information               | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    |        |
| Area                           | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    |        |
| Clip / ClipArea / ClipPattern  | Yes    | Yes    | No     | Unclear how to compute the information. |
| EffectArea                     | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    |        |
| EnemyPath                      | No     | No     | No     |        |
| GlidePath                      | No     | No     | No     |        |
| GravityPath                    | No     | No     | No     |        |
| IntroCamera                    | No     | No     | No     |        |
| ItemPath                       | No     | No     | No     |        |
| JugemPath                      | No     | No     | No     |        |
| LapPath                        | No     | No     | No     |        |
| Obj                            | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    |        |
| Path                           | Partly | Partly | No     | Can be visualized, but it's unclear how to solve custom curve point data. |
| ReplayCamera                   | No     | No     | No     |        |
| SoundObj                       | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    |        |

If supported sections reference others not imported yet (like an Obj a Path), they are referenced by index. This is okay, as those sections are not rewritten on export anyway and order is kept. Otherwise, real Blender ID references are used.

Installation
============

You require a full dump of the Mario Kart 8 game files.

- Install the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/Syroot/io_scene_bfres">io_scene_bfres</a> first, as that addon will be used to load Obj models which appear on the track.
- Go to your Blender installation directory inside the version folder, and then to `scripts` > `addons`.
- Create a new folder called "io_scene_mk8muunt".
- Copy in all `*.py` files from the `src` folder of this repository.
- In the Blender user preferences, enable the 'Import-Export: Mario Kart 8 Course Info format' add-on.
- You have to provide the path to your Mario Kart 8 `vol` directory (in which the DLC and the `content` folder resides in) so that the add-on can find the path to the `objflow.byaml` file and Obj models. You can set this path in the add-on preferences by expanding the add-on's section there.
